# Lem-in
School 21 project 

## Task
We have a ants farm - it's rooms and the tunnels connecting these rooms. The goal of the project is to find the _quickest way_ to guide N ants through this farm. 
_Quickest way_ means the solution with the least number of lines, respecting the output format requested in subject.

### Basic constraints: 
* To be the first to arrive, ants will need to take the shortest path (and that isnâ€™t necessarily the simplest). 
* They will also need to avoid traffic jams and do not walking over their fellow ants.
